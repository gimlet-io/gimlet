## Overview

Kubernetes deployment tooling.

- You can start with as little Kubernetes as you want - even on your laptop.
- Then progress to a gitops based application delivery platform when you need to.

Gimlet composes the best of open-source out of the box.

## Install the CLI
#### CLI
Linux / Mac

```console
curl -L "https://github.com/gimlet-io/gimlet/releases/download/cli-v0.27.0/gimlet-$(uname)-$(uname -m)" -o gimlet
chmod +x gimlet
sudo mv ./gimlet /usr/local/bin/gimlet
gimlet --version
```

## Dashboard Installation

On this page you can learn how to install the open-source Gimlet on any Kubernetes cluster.

If you prefer to use our hosted SaaS platform, [sign up here](https://gimlet.io/signup) then skip ahead to [connect a Kubernetes cluster](#connect-your-cluster).

### Prerequisites

- A [Github.com](https://github.com) personal or organization account.
- A Kubernetes cluster running on your laptop or on a cloud provider. We recommend using k3d on your laptop if you are evaluating Gimlet. It takes only a single command to start one, and it runs in a container.

#### Launching k3d on your laptop - optional

K3d is a lightweight Kubernetes cluster that runs in a container on your laptop. At Gimlet, we use k3d solely for our local needs and we recommend you do the same.

Install k3d with:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then launch a cluster:

```
k3d cluster create gimlet-cluster --k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"
```

Once your cluster is up, validate it with `kubectl get nodes`:

```
INFO[0000] Prep: Network
INFO[0000] Created network 'k3d-gimlet-cluster'
INFO[0000] Created image volume k3d-gimlet-cluster-images

INFO[0018] Cluster 'my-first-cluster' created successfully!
INFO[0018] You can now use it like this:
kubectl cluster-info

$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                          STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
k3d-gimlet-cluster-server-0   Ready    control-plane,master   11s   v1.26.4+k3s1
```

### Install Gimlet with a oneliner

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gimlet-io/gimlet/main/deploy/gimlet.yaml
```

Then access it with port-forward on [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000)

```
kubectl port-forward svc/gimlet 9000:9000
```

#### Admin password

You can find the admin password in the logs:

```
$ kubectl logs deploy/gimlet | grep "Admin auth key"
time="2023-07-14T14:28:59Z" level=info msg="Admin auth key: 1c04722af2e830c319e590xxxxxxxx" file="[dashboard.go:55]"
```

#### Alternative installation method

We generate the Kubernetes manifests from a Helm chart. You can use this configuration directly with Helm if you prefer.

```
helm template gimlet onechart/onechart \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gimlet-io/gimlet/main/fixtures/gimlet-helm-values.yaml
```

For all Gimlet environment variables, see the [Gimlet configuration reference](/docs/gimlet-configuration-reference).

### Basic configuration

#### Connect your repositories

To connect your git repositories to Gimlet, follow the on-screen guides.

Important to note:

- When you integrate with Github, you don't give access to any third party or the makers of Gimlet.
- The integration allows for fine-grained permission grants. You can pick the repositories that you want to integrate with Gimlet.

#### Connect your cluster

Navigate to the "Environments" tab.

Notice that Gimlet created a dummy environment for you. Normally you would call your environments staging or production, but this is a dummy environment, mine is called _Bold Grass_ ðŸ™ƒ.

Follow the steps on screen to connect your cluster.
