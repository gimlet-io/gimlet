## License

We switched to a source-available license with source code still hosted on Github.

[Pricing](https://gimlet.io/pricing)

#### Self-host

If you self-host Gimlet for commercial purposes, you need to purchase the license, which is $300 for a year. 
Non-profit and individual use of Gimlet is free and comes without usage limitations.

#### Cloud

You'll start with a 7-day trial to evaluate if Gimlet is helpful for you.

On the technical level, you'll start off with an ephemeral infrastructure provided by us for the trial period and can't connect any real clusters until you purchase the license.

After your purchase, you can connect your own Kubernetes clusters and move your applications to this permanent infrastructure.

Your license will expire a year after your purchase.

#### FAQ: I self-hosted Gimlet before the license change. How can I use it now?

We switched to a source-available license with source code still hosted on Github.

You are required to purchase a license once you upgrade to Gimlet 1.0 and above. As per our pricing you may be eiligible to our free tier.

You are also free to write to us and we probably grant a free license to you. We are grateful for people who trusted us from the early days.
